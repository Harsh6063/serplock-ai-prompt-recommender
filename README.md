- Understanding their business automatically
- Generating AI Search prompts relevant to their product
- Ranking those prompts using a scoring framework
- Recommending the highest-value prompts to track

Although demonstrated using **Serplock.com**, the architecture is generic and works for any website.

# 🧠 Prompt Scoring Framework

Each prompt is ranked using multiple weighted factors.

| Factor | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Business Relevance | How closely the prompt matches the business |
| Commercial Intent | Buying intent of the query |
| Search Intent | Awareness, Consideration, or Decision stage |
| Entity Coverage | Coverage of important entities/features |
| Prompt Quality | Readability and usefulness |
| Uniqueness | Removes repetitive recommendations |

The highest scoring prompts are recommended to the user.
